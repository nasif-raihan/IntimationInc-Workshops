# IntimationInc. Blog Development
A simple blog development project implementing various design pattern best practices
## Background
I.I. is a small team of software developers. Currently, we have a small platform where we provide different kinds of services. However, we don’t have a good marketing budget. For that reason, we are planning to develop a small blog where we will allow developers to write posts on various topics. Please note this is a very simple blog and do not develop anything more than expected.

## Sprint Plan

| Week  | Target                                                                                                                                                                                            | Remark                                                                                                                                                               | Reviewed Done | Reviewed By                                                                                      |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Week 1** | Let's start creating a blog endpoint where logged in users can create a blog post and allow adding comments to the posts too. <br> **Posts should have title, description** <br> **Comment should contain just a simple comment** <br> **Note**: No need to create a login endpoint. Consider it is done already. Just check if user is logged in when creating a post or adding a comment. |  |  |  |
| **Week 2** | We need a scoring system in our blog to inspire users to write more. Add a support system for post <br> **If user who supported a post is admin then add 1 reputation to the post author** <br> **If user who supported is not an admin add score 1 to the post** |  |  |  |
| **Week 3** | We have got lots of enthusiastic people on our blog. Unfortunately, some of the writers are juniors and they could really improve if proper review/feedback is given to them. But these reviews should be private and only the author of the blog should be able to see it. Multiple reviews can be created for a single post. <br> **We need to add a review system** <br> Only admins can review <br> Review should contain mandatory field title <br> Review can contain optional fields: <br> - Content - description of review <br> - Rating - add a rating out of 5 <br> - Pros <br> - Cons <br> - Recommendation <br> - Idea <br> - Author feedback <br> **Note**: At frontend we might show different versions of review form with various combinations of optional fields depending on user experience feedback. So keep the flexibility so that new review submit endpoints can be created. |  |  |  |
| **Week 4** | Sometimes our users are facing some exceptions. We need to track those down. We need to create a simple logger that can log a simple text supplied to a local file `logs/custom.log` From anywhere in the project we should be able to log a simple string. Please keep in mind a file is a resource and you cannot access it parallelly. <br> **Note**: We will explore how to use mutex in singleton. |  |  |  |
| **Week 5** | We maintain a database table with video id and url from our YouTube channel. From the database, we show a list of videos to the frontend and frontend loads them from one endpoint. Just create the endpoint for sending data to the frontend. |  |  |  |
| **Week 6** | Managing this video manually is getting painful, we don't want to load them to database but by YouTube client we want to get the list of videos and then send to the frontend. We need separate endpoint but frontend needs the data in the same structure as we got from database so that we don't need to change too much at frontend. |  |  |  |
| **Week 7** | We show some banners on the homepage from the stock photos service. Please add an endpoint that will use the services client to get data and show us. |  |  |  |
| **Week 8** | Our banner client is sending banner data with EXIF data. Which is not compliant with data security. We need to scrub off EXIF data immediately and send only image data. |  |  |  |
| **Week 9** | We want to allow people to be reviewers; provided they pay us a fee after some manual interview. For now, the amount is 500 dollars one time. Add a payment endpoint so that users can pay us the amount. User should be able to choose a payment method either bank, mobile banking or PayPal. Upon payment completion, the User should automatically be a reviewer. |  |  |  |
| **Week 10** | Intimationinc has a physical library business now. We sell various kinds of books. We also offer exciting prices much lower than other shops. We want a book details page where it will show book-related data. Give us an endpoint which will return details of a book. |  |  |  |
| **Week 11** | Our sales skyrocketed after showing books online. In physical shops, we also sell some bundles like “himu somogro” which contain a collection of books. We also have bundles of bundles like “sci-fi bundle” which contains a few random books, sci-fi bundle of Jafor Iqbal etc. <br> Please create a bundle details page where we can show all the books inside a bundle. |  |  |  |
| **Week 12** | We have signed an MOU with the AS-Sunnah Foundation. We want to show hadith on our website using their one day one hadith service. They have provided us with a PHP client library. Please integrate that. |  |  |  |
| **Week 13** | The hadith we are sending raised some concerns. Our international writers are from other religions and they don’t want to see the ad. Can we somehow apply this filter? |  |  |  |
| **Week 14** | Our bundle detail page is so slow. The API response is taking longer to load. Can you please analyze how we can improve? It's making so many requests to the database for each and every bundle. |  |  |  |
| **Week 15** | Now we are suffering from SEO issues. There is so much copy-paste content. So, we want to check the quality of a post after it is created. We will use Grammarly service to check grammar quality, we will use Gemini API to check brevity and copy not service for checking plagiarism. Please make this service so that we can use it on demand for new posts and as a cron job for all past posts. |  |  |  |
| **Week 16** | Good news or sad? We are now under taxation. We need to provide a user signup information report, payment report, post report in JSON and HTML format. In the future, we might need more and more reports and more formatting might be needed. |  |  |  |
